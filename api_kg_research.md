# API Knowledge Graph Research

## Value Proposition

Building a knowledge graph (KG) from many GitHub repositories for APIs can provide significant value for developers, organizations, and researchers. It enables advanced discoverability, dependency analysis, documentation mining, community insights, and automated reasoning across the API ecosystem.

## Use Cases

- **API Landscape Mapping:** Visualize relationships between APIs, libraries, and frameworks for better discovery and navigation.
- **Dependency and Compatibility Analysis:** Analyze dependencies, compatibility, and impact of changes across APIs.
- **Documentation and Example Mining:** Extract and link code examples, usage patterns, and documentation to code entities.
- **Community and Contribution Insights:** Map contributor networks and project health.
- **Automated Recommendations:** Suggest APIs, identify deprecated usage, and recommend migration paths.
- **Research and Analytics:** Study trends, technology adoption, and security/compliance across the ecosystem.

## Challenges

- **Data Extraction:** Parsing code, documentation, and metadata from diverse repositories.
- **Entity Resolution:** Linking related entities and resolving naming conflicts across projects.
- **Scalability:** Efficiently storing, querying, and visualizing large-scale graphs.
- **Data Quality:** Ensuring accuracy and relevance of extracted relationships.

## Potential Approaches

- Use static analysis and NLP to extract API entities, dependencies, and usage patterns from code and documentation.
- Leverage existing tools (e.g., GitHub API, language parsers, docstring analyzers) for data collection.
- Apply graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) or RDF triple stores for scalable storage and querying.
- Integrate visualization tools for interactive exploration of the API knowledge graph.

## Next Steps

- Define the scope and target languages/frameworks for the KG.
- Develop or adapt extraction pipelines for code, documentation, and metadata.
- Design the schema and ontology for representing API entities and relationships.
- Prototype the KG with a subset of repositories and iterate based on findings.

## Choosing the Right Knowledge Graph Model for APIs

### Model Options and Suitability

- **hSBM (Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model):**
  - Best for discovering hierarchical community structure in homogeneous graphs (e.g., word co-occurrence, citation networks).
  - Useful for clustering similar APIs or tightly coupled modules.
  - Not designed for multi-relational, heterogeneous graphs with rich entity and relationship types.

- **Property Graph Model (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph):**
  - Nodes represent APIs, libraries, repositories, contributors, etc.
  - Edges represent typed relationships (depends_on, implements, authored_by, etc.).
  - Supports flexible queries, analytics, and visualization.
  - Well-suited for the multi-relational, entity-rich nature of API ecosystems.

- **RDF/OWL (Semantic Web):**
  - Uses triples (subject–predicate–object) and ontologies to define classes and properties.
  - Enables interoperability, reasoning, and linking with external datasets.
  - Ideal for standardized data sharing and semantic search.

- **Hybrid Approaches:**
  - Combine property graphs for flexible querying and visualization with community detection (like hSBM) for clustering subgraphs (e.g., dependency networks).

### Summary Table

| Model Type         | Best For                                      | Example Tech         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Property Graph     | Multi-relational, flexible queries, analytics | Neo4j, JanusGraph   |
| RDF/OWL            | Semantic web, interoperability, reasoning     | GraphDB, Blazegraph  |
| hSBM/Community     | Clustering, topic modeling, subgraph analysis | graph-tool, igraph   |

### Recommendation

For API knowledge graphs, a property graph or RDF/OWL model is usually the best fit for representing the rich, multi-relational structure and supporting advanced queries and analytics. hSBM is valuable for clustering and community detection within homogeneous subgraphs, but not as the main KG structure.

*Consider using a property graph or RDF/OWL as your primary KG, and apply hSBM or other clustering algorithms to specific subgraphs if you want to analyze communities of related APIs or modules.*

## Strategy for Architecture and Implementation Recommendations from API KGs

### Overview
To recommend system architectures, project templates, and rough implementations for new use cases, build a property graph-based KG from a large collection of API repositories. This enables semantic search, pattern mining, and template generation tailored to user needs.

### Schema/Ontology Design
- **Nodes:** API, Library, Framework, Project, Module, Class, Function, Contributor, Use Case, Project Template, etc.
- **Edges:** depends_on, uses, implements, contributed_by, similar_to, example_of, etc.
- **Properties:** Language, tags, description, version, license, usage frequency, etc.

### Data Extraction Pipeline
- **Static Analysis:** Parse code to extract entities (classes, functions, modules) and relationships (imports, calls, inheritance).
- **NLP/Docstring Mining:** Extract use cases, descriptions, and example code from documentation and comments.
- **Repository Metadata:** Use GitHub API for stars, forks, contributors, topics, etc.
- **Template/Boilerplate Detection:** Identify common project structures and templates by analyzing directory layouts and config files.

### Recommendation Engine
- **Architecture/Design Recommendation:** Given a use case, use semantic search and graph traversal to find similar projects, architectures, and API combinations. Leverage code/document embeddings for semantic similarity.
- **Project Template Suggestion:** Recommend project templates (directory structures, config files, starter code) that match the use case and technology stack.
- **Rough Implementation Generation:** Suggest code snippets, API combinations, and auto-generate skeleton code by combining patterns from similar projects.

### Advanced Features
- **Pattern Mining:** Use frequent subgraph mining or motif detection to find common architectural patterns.
- **Community Detection:** Optionally, use hSBM or other clustering on subgraphs to identify clusters of related APIs or design patterns.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Allow users to explore the KG, see recommended architectures, and drill down into example projects.

### Workflow Example
1. **User provides a use case:** "Build a REST API for a real-time chat application with authentication and WebSocket support in Python."
2. **System queries the KG:** Finds similar projects, identifies commonly used libraries, suggests a project template, and provides code snippets and example links.
3. **User receives:** Recommended architecture diagram, project template, example code, and documentation links.

### Summary Table

| Component                | Role/Benefit                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Property Graph KG        | Rich, multi-relational representation             |
| Static/NLP Extraction    | Populate KG with code, docs, and metadata         |
| Recommendation Engine    | Match use cases to architectures/templates        |
| Pattern Mining           | Discover reusable design/implementation patterns  |
| Visualization            | Explore, explain, and justify recommendations     |
